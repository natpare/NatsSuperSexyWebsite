## Whale Research Internship

This summer and fall, I have worked as a whale research intern through the Blue Ocean Society abord the M/V Granite State recording data about marine mammals and large fish we see, as well as marine debris. It has been a phenomenal year of whale watching, so I wanted to include some images I've taken of some rare sightings we've had!

## Seal Acoustics

I am working with BIOL860's own Jess Veo on her grey seal overwintering acoustic project!

## Humpbacks and Vessel Noise (and more acoustics)

Last year, I worked with Melanie Smith to annotate humpback whale, killer whale, and harbor seal vocalizations as well as vessel noise in Southeast Alaska for her Master's project!
